Senior Design Project for EECS 395

Campus Scheduler is an application that will utilize a studentâ€™s Google Calendar to suggest and add optimal meeting times for student groups. The novelty of this application lies in its ability to recommend times that work for everyone as well as central meeting locations that minimize the distances students need to travel to get to the various locations.
